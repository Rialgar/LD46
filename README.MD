This game is fully implemented using html5 + javascript. Any modern browser should be able to run it, but I only tested in Google Chrome.

I am pretty happy with this one, I purposefully made all the graphics using the html canvas with no pre-drawn images, but I still achieved a pretty good result. This allowed me to easily modify the graphics to react dynamically to stuff. I used almost the entire second day to add pzazz and really enjoy the results.
